#### Best practice and useful software


Looking for useful links to open science tools, Github walkthroughs, communication software etc. 


#### Open notebook examples 


#### Github help

The [Github Help](https://help.github.com/) website is excellent with the most common FAQs. [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/) has multiple tutorials, starting with setting up a repo, using a repo, and how to create a website using Github Pages, among other things.

#### For those coding in Python

#### For those coding in R

You will no doubt live on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) when running any kind of R analysis - if you are experiencing a problem, it is almost guaranteed that someone else has had that problem and they have asked it (and had it answered) on Stack Overflow.

Maybe more relevant for psychologists, or psychology-related fields, is Andy Field's website [Discovering Statistics](https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/). Andy Field is a psychology/statistics lecturer and has written multiple books to help understand the core stats equations behind the functions used, as well as step-by-step help to utilise those functions in R. If you need to try a different kind of analysis but aren't sure where to start learning the basics about it, it is probably here. 

#### Open access journals

The [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) is a directory of all currently listed OA journals. This can help by letting you know whether the journal you want to publish in is OA or not (if you are unsure), what the APCs are, and any editorial and submission information. It can also be searched for articles, not only for journals.


With the rise of the open access movement, there has also been a rise in 'predatory' journals. The information at [Thick Check Submit](http://thinkchecksubmit.org/) provides some excellent guidelines to help decide which journal you want to send to.
