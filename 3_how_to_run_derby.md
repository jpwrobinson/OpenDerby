### How to run a research derby?

#### 1. First meeting, hypothesis, and Github

First, find a group of excited researchers (i.e. graduate students, post-docs, PIs) and meet to discuss research question possibilities and access to open data sets. 

Need an idea? See our [list of questions and datasets](https://github.com/jpwrobinson/OpenDerby/blob/master/4_research_qs_data.md) from researchers who are looking for collaborators!. 

Next, set up your Derby on GitHub. We recommend using a single public repository with every participant [added as a collaborator.](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) If you find success with other collaboration models (e.g. forking), let us know!

Remember, this repository is your public holding place for all meeting notes, ideas, writing and datasets. In other words, **Github is your Open Notebook!**

Once you have decided on a question/idea (this may take several meetings - stick at it!) and identified an appropriate open dataset you're ready to start the research process!

#### 2. Data wrangling, literature review, and statistics 

Day-to-day derby tasks should be run however the Derby leader wishes. You might want to split up major tasks between individuals or pairs - data cleaning and exploring, literature review, testing statistical approaches. 

At this point, conduct your research in whichever framework is most familiar for you and your research group. BUT, however you decide to do it, make sure that every task is open!

We recommend the following breakdown:

**For data things** (storage, analysis, (e.g. R/Python/bash scripts), figures, and writing in reproducible text documents (e.g. R markdown, LaTeX)): pull, add, commit, and push through GitHub. 

*[Github's large file storage system](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is useful for working with large datasets.*

**For literature review things**: we've found that Google sheets are great ways of gathering notes. You could also use [Mendeley's online Groups feature](https://www.mendeley.com/) to keep papers organised.

**For communication**: derbies may be run by groups that share offices, or by people living on different continents. Either way, it's incredibly useful to keep a record of every conversation and every decision you make during a research project. There are lots of ways to do this, some of our favourites are:

* We like using [Slack](https://slack.com/) for keeping everyone updated/messaging eachother   
* We also like using the [Issues](https://github.com/baumlab/open-science-project/issues) in GitHub to keep track of problems and decisions  
* [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/) is a great tool for structuring video calls and keeping track of discussion

#### 3. Writing manuscript and selecting a journal

When you've finished writing up your findings, submit your manuscript to an open access journal! 

Need inspiration? Check our [resources page.](https://github.com/jpwrobinson/OpenDerby/blob/master/5_resources.md) Some high impact journals have started to offer open access options (but often for a fee), or you could consider using a preprint server (such as [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/)) while submitting to the journal of your choice.

You will have written your manuscript in a reproducible text format that might incorporate your data and scripts (like R markdown). [Some journals are thinking about accepting submissions in this format](https://elifesciences.org/labs/cad57bcf/composing-reproducible-manuscripts-using-r-markdown) but it's more likely that you'll need to convert to Word or PDF before submission. Not to worry, you could provide the reproducible file as supplementary material and suggest the reviewers rerun your full paper!
