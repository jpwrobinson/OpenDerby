## Join OpenDerby at #mozsprint 2017!

I'm excited to let you know that OpenDerby is part of Mozilla’s Global Sprint https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/ on June 1st and 2nd, 2017. This is a fast-paced, fun two-day collaborative work event where we’ll come together online and in person to work and hack on open projects. 

**WELCOME SPRINTERS! To contribute, check out our [Issues tracker.](https://github.com/jpwrobinson/OpenDerby/issues)** We’re looking for R, Python and Git content and links, open data, and OpenDerby organizers.

#### What is Open Derby?

Open Derby solves an unanswered science problem in **open** collaboration. Participants will combine open data, Github, and Jupyter/R-markdown in an **open notebook** to ensure their findings are reproducible and openly available.  

We've written a short manual explaining what OpenDerby is, and how you can adapt it for your own open needs.

* [What is an Open Derby?](/2_what_is_derby.md)
* [How to run an Open Derby](/3_how_to_run_derby.md)
* [Research questions for Derbies](/4_research_qs_data.md)
* [Open resources](/5_resources.md)

#### Who is Open Derby for?

The derby concept is targeted at any research group, from coding clubs to academic labs, who want to:

1. Adopt open science tools for their own research
2. Learn how to collaborate openly
3. Support open science with an open notebook publication

We expect that most derbies will be run for graduate students who are interested in learning open science tools, but we encourage post-docs and PIs to take a leadership role. 

In addition to learning new skills and gaining a publication, graduate students may also use Open Derby for course credit (though this will depend on the university curriculum)

#### How can I use Open Derby?

Anyone can run their own Open Derby! We do suggest that the lead organizer is a senior PhD student, post-doc, or PI who already has some experience with using Github. All participants should also have a basic understanding of coding in R or Python.

#### How can I contribute to Open Derby?

Although each derby will be unique, we encourage participants to share their open insights: 

* which tools worked well for your lab group?
* how did you write the manuscript?
* did you find any interesting datasets?
* what did you publish?!
