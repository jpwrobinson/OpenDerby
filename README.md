# OpenDerby

#### What is Open Derby?

Open Derby solves an unanswered science problem in **open** collaboration. Participants will combine open data, Github, and R-markdown in an **open notebook** to ensure their findings are reproducible and openly available.  

We've written a short manual explaining what OpenDerby is, and how you can adapt it for your own open needs.

#### Who is Open Derby for?

The derby concept is targeted at any research group, from coding clubs to academic labs, who want to:

1. Adopt open science tools for their own research
2. Learn how to collaborate openly
3. Support open science with an open notebook publication

We expect that most derbies will be run for graduate students who are interested in learning open science tools, but we encourage post-docs and PIs to take a leadership role. 

In addition to learning new skills and gaining a publication, graduate students may also use Open Derby for course credit (though this will depend on the university curriculum) 

#### How can I use Open Derby?

Anyone can run their own Open Derby! We do suggest that the lead organizer is a senior PhD student, post-doc, or PI who already has some experience with using Github. All participants should also have a basic understanding of coding.

#### How can I contribute to Open Derby?

Although each derby will be unique, we encourage participants to share their open insights: 

* which tools worked well for your lab group?
* how did you write the manuscript?
* did you find any interesting datasets?
* what did you publish?!

Please contribute to the Open Derby material by **forking** this repository. If you'd like to become more involved with the project, email James Robinson for direct write access.
